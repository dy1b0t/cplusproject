# Corner Grocer Grocery-Tracking Program

## Project Overview
This project is designed for Corner Grocer to optimize their produce layout based on the frequency of purchases. The C++ program offers a user-friendly interface for tracking item frequencies, displaying a complete list of items with their frequencies, and visualizing the data through histograms. It also creates a backup data file.

## Key Achievements and Future Improvements
- **Strengths**: My approach was effective in data processing and creating an intuitive user interface.
- **Areas for Enhancement**: Future enhancements could include optimizing the program for larger datasets to improve efficiency and scalability.

## Challenges and Development
- **Challenges Faced**: Implementing the histogram visualization posed significant challenges, addressed through additional research and trial-and-error.
- **Resources Utilized**: Leveraged online forums and coding communities for support and problem-solving.
- **Skills Gained**: The project honed my skills in data handling, UI design, and code optimization, applicable in diverse programming scenarios.

## Code Maintainability
- **Strategies Employed**: The program is structured for easy maintenance and adaptability, with clear in-line documentation and a modular code layout.
